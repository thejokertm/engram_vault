	- **21120701** – Build a life that is conductive to the experiences you want to have.
	- **21120705** – Who are you to deem any human existence a failure or a success? It is probably neither. Focus on the things you can change.
	- **21120801** – Try to be better and wake up every morning questioning what that process looks like.
	- **21120904** – Be humble, but never dismissive of your own abilities.
	- **21121401** – Push, push, push! Don't let things just pass, you can change things, be proactive, learn fro philip. You don't do idle times !(?)
	- **21121700** – How do I embrace my limitations? I have experienced them, understood them, and accepted them, how do I embrace them?
	- **21111807** – Do what you have to do in this system to free yourself from it. Don't feel bad about this, it has no use. Always pursue the best solution possible! The goal is to make enough money with the least amount of effort, and on your own terms as much as possible. Play the game, make use of all loopholes, don't feel bad about that. You simply want to maintain yourself in the position to actually create the meaning you want to create. This is not a means in itself! It is a natural part of living in this system.
	- **21122102** – Don't hide yourself from the world, no matter how ugly things get, pick up the pieces and show yourself.
