Capitalism presents us with a simple promise. If you give a considerable amount of your time and attention, you will be rewarded with something desired by all: wealth. 

If you give enough, you will receive enough. You will belong to this infamous group of happy individuals that call themselves the wealthy. These clean, crisp notes of paper, with emblems on them, representing nations, tradition, history, freedom and endless possibilities, will slip through your hands faster than a melting ice cube. There seems to be a problem, a problem of delusion.

These tokens are to be exchanged for something else, drawing your psyche into a deliciously devilish circle of rinse and repeat. Make money, and exchange it for happiness. Our natural sense for action is turned on its head. Wanting more becomes wanting to buy more.

Fancy wallets. Exotic juices. Slick phones. blazing fast cars. Expansive homes. A trip to the Fiji Islands that will change your life. Everything can be bought, it seems.

Working more, buying more, and all the while something dwindles away, slowly fades into the darkness of your 4k smartphone display â€“ your time and attention.

Focus on [The Essential](the-essential.md). Question your desires and track them to to their roots. In doing so, being wealthy can attain a new meaning. Be generous with your time and attention, but give them to people, give them to your immediate experience of the present. The vast spectacle of your senses, available to you at every breathing moment, is a miracle no dollar bill should be able to compete with. Wouldn't you be willing to renounce some of these distractions to regain access to a core part of your humanity?
