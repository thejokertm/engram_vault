I feel strongly that one of our most inner desires is to give something back to the world. The problem with this is that we have seemingly run ourselves into a corner (see [[world-pain|World Pain]]).

I am not going to be able to change the world, but can I find a reason for being within it? Can I contribute something to the betterment of only one individual?

The answer to the challenge of our times lies in discovering what you can do, and doing it. Do not remain silent. Do not remain passive.

It's not about fair-trade or bio products â€“ it's about not denying your presence in this world. Don't think for a second that you don't have *impact*.

Remaining in hiding, closing your eyes, numbing yourself to everything, to all this pain. Is this part of our nature? Yes, it's natural, understandable even. But it's also the ultimate waste of time.
