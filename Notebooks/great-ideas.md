Don't let ideas fade into oblivion just because you are addicted to feeling nothing. 

Numbing episodes are a funny thing. They arise out of the sheer intensity and variety of human sensations. Every day, every second, it just does not stop. But it can, for a price. Narcotics, alcohol, even the emptiness that can follow casual sexual pleasure, it is a feeling of nothingness that can extend into a perceived infinity.

But even amidst the silence, sometimes ideas emerge. And these are prone to vanish as fast as they came, simply because there is no strength left to retain them, to act on them. Don't let them fade.
