Do what you have to do in this system to free yourself from it. Don't feel bad about this (see [World Pain](world-pain.md)), it has no use. Always pursue the best solution possible!

The goal is to make enough money with the least amount of effort, and on your own terms as much as possible.

Play the game, make use of all loopholes, don't feel bad about that. You simply want to maintain yourself in the position to actually create the meaning you want to create. This is not a means in itself! It is a natural part of living in this system.

### Editor notes
- There is nothing natural about this.
- The most money for the least effort might not be a good paradigm to live by, because if you are doing what you love, isn't spending effort a good thing?
- Is this just my way to rationalize [World Pain](world-pain.md)?
