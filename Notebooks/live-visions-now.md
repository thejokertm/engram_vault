Live as if you have already attained the state of mind you are going for. Try to turn your visions into reality with what you have in front of you, right now.

If you want to be more creative, for example, but don't have the space, the tools, the means, work with what you have. This is a kind of abundance mentality that will always lead you to look for happiness where it already is, right here in the present.

â€“

Example: you can live the studio dream right now, you might not have the space, but you can create.

Find ways to live the live you want with the things you already have.

The studio life includes different kinds of art:
- drawing, pencils, watercolors, ink, etc.
- Ton, Gibs
- Calligraphy
- Paper Art
- Music production / digital
- Arduino / Tech crafting
- Learning an instrument
- Writing freely.
- Studio also means learning, not just expression: different courses, skills, literary works, etc.
