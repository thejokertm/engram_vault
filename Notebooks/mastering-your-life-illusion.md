Managing or mastering your time and life is something that can never fully be achieved, because we ourselves are an integral part of what we are trying to master. Our ability to look at ourselves created this conflict and point of frustration.

All that really makes sense, is to try and focus on the next best thing, spend your time trying to do something meaningful: the next most necessary thing!
