What is truly worth our time? Again and again, investing into your capability to pay attention seems to be the most fundamental skill we have.

In a world where a [Global Advertising Industry](global-advertizing-industry.md) is fighting for your attention at every turn, it becomes more important than ever to have a degree of control over what you focus on. This is often such a problem that we don't even fully know to what we pay attention. Proof of this are various studies done that show our attention spawn decreasing as humanity continues to evolve.

Meditation, or simply, the practice of focus, is a simple way to practice being in the present. Dedicate a short portion of every day to sharpening your ability to pay attention. The better you can focus on the things that matter to you, the happier you will be.
