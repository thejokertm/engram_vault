Capitalism presents us with a simple promise. If you give a considerable amount of your time and attention, you will be rewarded with something desired by all: wealth. 

If you give enough, you will receive enough. You will belong to this infamous group of happy individuals that call themselves the wealthy. You will have money. But these clean, crisp notes of paper will slip through your hands faster than a melting ice cube.

These tokens exist to be exchanged for something else, drawing your psyche into a devilish circle of rinse and repeat. Make money, and exchange it for happiness. Our natural sense for action is turned against itself. Wanting more becomes wanting to buy more.

Fancy wallets. Exotic juices. Slick phones. blazing fast cars. Expansive homes. A trip to the Fiji Islands that will change your life. Everything can be bought, it seems.

Work more, buy more, and all the while something dwindles away, slowly fades into the darkness of your 4k smartphone display – your time and attention.

Wouldn't you be willing let go of some of this so called wealth to regain access to a core part of your humanity?

–
Focus on [The Essential](the-essential.md). Question your desires and track them to to their roots. In doing so, being wealthy can attain a new meaning. Be generous with your time and attention, but give them to people, give them to your immediate experience of the present. The vast spectacle of your senses, available to you at every breathing moment, is a miracle no dollar bill should be able to compete with. Wouldn't you be willing to renounce some of these distractions to regain access to a core part of your humanity?
