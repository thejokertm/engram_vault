Capitalism presents us with a simple promise. If you give a considerable amount of your time and attention, you will be rewarded with something desired by all: wealth. 

At first, you will have more than enough of this infamous matter. Paper notes slip into your fingers and represent freedom and endless possibilities. But there is a problem. Once you exchange these tokens for something else, your psyche is drawn into a whirlwind of delusion. Your sense of action is turned into something else. Wanting more becomes wanting to buy more.

Fancy wallets. Exotic juices. Slick phones. blazing fast cars. Expansive homes. A trip to the Fiji Islands that will change your life. Everything can be bought, it seems.

Working more, buying more, and all the while something dwindles away, slowly fades into the darkness of your 4k smartphone display â€“ time, and attention.

What does wealth actually mean? And do we really need 1 billion dollars? Work less, live more.

The vast spectacle of your senses allow you to experience at every living moment is something that no single dollar bill should be able to compete with. Give your attention generously but to people, not to these false friends that seem to govern our universe.

We need to rethink the paradigms that our society is built on. Wouldn't you want to give some of your wealth to regain access to what makes you human?

Capitalism promises us a life of means if we work everyday. It is expected of us to give, at the very least, 40 hours a week, all in a misguided attempt to maintain our standard of living, maintain our wealth ("Wohlstandserhaltung").

There is no balance. You give your life, but you cannot possibly receive that back in return. Human beings are creatures of action, don't let capitalism pervert that, find a way back to our nature.
