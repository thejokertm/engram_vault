The always-on culture we have created around our services and products is not the problem. The motivation behind making everything available to us at all times is not inherently a bad thing. It's understandable.

The problem is the cost and the limited pool of benefactors. If this surplus of availability is retained exclusively for a selected few, and itself at the cost of a large majority, then thats the problem.

We are building these products and services not for the majority, but for a selected few at the cost of the majority. It's not sustainable and it leads to [World Pain](world-pain.md).
