Things and tools in and of themselves are not the problem, it's how these things get into our hands that is inherently flawed.

The always-on culture we have created around our services and products is not the problem. The motivation behind making everything available to us at all times, it's not inherently evil. The problem relates to cost and the limited pool of benefactors. If this surplus of availability is retained exclusively for a selected few, and itself at the cost of a large majority, then thats the problem.
