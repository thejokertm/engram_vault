Do not avoid confrontation. It can be painful, it can put you at odds with yourself, but it is also the only chance to progress. It is worth it because you will be refining what you thought you could do.

Don't run. Whatever it is that you are running from, it is going to catch up. The farther you run, the harder it is going to hit you- Don't prolong the inevitable. Face your fear and your own suffering. This is the only way forward.
