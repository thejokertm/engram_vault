There is a clear balance between caring for the internal, the personal and the external. Don't spend too much time with either.

The internal, the personal. This is your inner world, the vast landscapes that are shaped by emotions, hormones and other biological processes.

the external, the public. This is the life you lead in the realm of things and people.

Caring for both of these dimensions equally, is important. Maintain that balance, never give in too much, neither to the loneliness of a life in the private sphere, nor to the escapism the material world offers.
