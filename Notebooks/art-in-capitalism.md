Art is the creation of something outside of this rule set, the only time anyone really gets to do this, never take that away from it, the innocence of it, the purity

The beauty of art, of unbound creativity, is that it can exist in a space outside of [Life in Capitalism](capitalism-and-your-life.md). Create something with no regard for financial gain. Art can be free from capitalism. It rarely is, but it is one of the only things that retains that spirit, that purity and innocence. We all have a drive to create, and when that happens outside of the rules of capitalism, it is cathartic.
