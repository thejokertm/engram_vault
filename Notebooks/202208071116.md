Capitalism promises us a life of means if we work everyday. It is expected of us to give, at the very least, 40 hours a week, all in a misguided attempt to maintain our standard of living, maintain our wealth ("Wohlstandserhaltung").

There is no balance. You give your life, but you cannot possibly receive that back in return. Human beings are creatures of action, don't let capitalism pervert that, find a way back to our nature.
