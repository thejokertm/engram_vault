# The Pain of the World
Today I felt pain of the world for the very first time. For an instant only, I understood on an emotional level that I am the benefactor of the suffering of others, seeing that and not wanting to change because I'm so in love with my own life, it tears me up.

No human being should be force to do any labour they don't want to do, this speaks against my very idea of freedom, and yet, I need people to do all kinds of obscene jobs for me to enjoy my standard of living. Deep down I know right from wrong, but because I am the benefactor, I cannot act on it.

This suffering, it was like a piercing pain that hit me out of nowhere, and left much more slowly, what remains was an emptiness and a feeling of being lost, of not knowing what to do.

I feel no anger against anyone for the state of the world, the greatest human weakness has been exploited and those who are the weakest are devoured first by this monster. I am only angry at myself, and this is something I can deal with. I am no better than anyone, not even Marc. This is no ones fault, there is no one to blame but yourself.
