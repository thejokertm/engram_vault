Investing into your capability to pay attention seems to be the most fundamental skill we have. Paying attention is one of the ways we can live a better live where so much seems to be at the mercy of the [global advertising industry](global-advertizing-industry.md) and [hypercapitalism](a-users-definition-of-hypercapitalism.md) in general. We want to be here for our lives and gain a better understanding of our own nature. Meditation teaches you to trust your own nature (see [Deep Trust](deep-trust.md)).

Forget everything you have ever associated with meditation and remember only this: Meditation is the practice of paying attention.
