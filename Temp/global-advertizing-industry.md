A massive global advertising industry is tasked with the sole purpose of making you believe you are not enough and you don't have enough. This is part of a [life in capitalism](a-users-definition-of-hypercapitalism.md). The system operates on establishing a sense of deficiency. You broke down and bought the flashiest flagship phone? Good, 6 months later you will be brought to believe that it's not enough anymore, now there is an even better device just for you. That car you just bought? Guess what. There is a better one available right now. Rinse and repeat.

We need to nourish a sense of content with who we are and what we have. Nobody is going to do that for us. The only thing you really want is not for sale â€“ happiness.
