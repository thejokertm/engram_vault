Dedicate a small portion of your day to reflect about your actions and decisions. This is a confrontation with yourself, it wont necessarily feel good. But that is the point.

Different from [meditation](meditation.md), self-reflection is active, it is an analysis of your present reaction to the past, necessary to build a better future.

At the end of the day, we have to be honest with ourselves. It is self-evident that as human beings we cannot always do right, we cannot always succeed. But if we don't reflect about what went right or wrong, there is no feedback cycle to become better.
