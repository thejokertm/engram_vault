Why is it so hard to be enough? It sounds good, something worth striving towards. That warm feeling that nothing needs to change, that everything is just as it should be, that you are just as you should be. Accepting our humanity and fallibility confronts us with one of the great paradoxes of our condition: if we are enough, then why strive to be better?

This is a problem. We are creatures of action, everything that we have built, everything that we have achieved, is predicated on the antithesis of being enough. Being enough stands in direct competition with our desire to better our circumstances. A careful balance needs to be struck. Work towards a better self, but not to your determent. Know which things to accept, and which things you can change.
