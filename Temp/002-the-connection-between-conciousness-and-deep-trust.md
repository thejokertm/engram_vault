[Deep Trust](deep-trust.md) operates on the assumption that there is something within us that has no external dependencies. You can't influence its existence at all. Consciousness as a constant provides a feeling of allrightness unlike any other. But where does it come from? 

## The Origins of Deep Trust

Deep Trust as I understand it is tied directly to your consciousness, to a deeper level that is accessible to all of us if we just pay attention. Everything that is going on in your life, all the thoughts, the memories, the chatter, the pain, the joy, is forever changing. There seems to be nothing to hold onto, forcing us to feverishly hold on to the good and push away the bad. The present blends into past and future before we ever get a chance to breathe. Time moves forwards relentlessly. But there is a mode of being that allows you to see all these things for what they are. Apparitions in consciousness. Even the very voice within your head that sounds so much like you, is something that you cannot always control. It changes, comes into focus, and fades into the background. 

Consciousness is the only constant of your life. It is the only thing that is with you from your first breath till the last. And it is there without you ever having to do anything for its existence. It feels like a cosmic gift. Natures true wonder. Knowing that you are the space in which everything arises, all the time, that you are none of the things that trouble you, that is the source of deep trust. It emerges from the very understanding that you are not who you think you are. In an ever changing inner landscape, consciousness is the only constant. Connecting with it means connecting with your true nature.

Everything that comes into view has a right to be there. The tears that run down your face the moment you understand that someone precious is never coming back. The joy of that comes from riding your bicycle. The ecstasy you feel when eating a slice of your favorite pizza.  It all belongs to you, it is a part of you. But it is not constant. Deep Trust emanates from the complete understanding of the constancy of consciousness.

## Paying Attention in our World

Practically speaking, accessing this mode of being requires little more than the determination to do so. I find that meditation can be a loaded term that instantly evokes Buddhist imagery of the total renouncement of everything we think and feel, when in reality it is the opposite. Meditation is about embracing the reality of experience that is so often clouded by a misguided identification with the contents of consciousness. Practicing meditation means accessing the only constant of your human experience. When you strip away the loaded imagery, the traditions, the religion, meditation is simply the practice of paying attention.

Our world is mostly build on a mindless mode of operation. Wake up. Work. Eat. Buy. Sleep. The system is not designed for rejection of its goods. Beyond instilling in us a sense of infinite alrightness, paying attention can lead to better decision-making. It can help us feel more alive. Im not talking about that carrot-on-a-stick version of aliveness, dependent on the things you don't own, how you fail to dress and what experiences you almost never had. I'm talking about re-discovering the magic of being who you already are, without all the nonsense you need to keep buying to prevent our society from collapsing.
