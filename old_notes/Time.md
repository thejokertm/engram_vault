# Time
*Monotony collapses time; novelty unfolds it. You can exercise daily and eat healthy and live a long life, while experiencing a short one. If you spend your life sitting in a cubicle and passing papers, one day is bound to blend unmemorably into the next – and disappear. That’s why it’s important to change routines regularly, and take vacations to exotic locales, and have as many new experiences as possible that can serve to anchor our memories. Creating new memories stretches out psychological time, and lengthens our perception of our lives.* – Joshua Foer, Moonwalking with Einstein

How then, can life be continuously exciting? What processes can I put in place ensure a constant stream of novelty? And why does it feel like I lack the energy to do so?
