# Use the effects of food to your advantage
Eating is an activity that brings with it a whole array of complications. I would argue, based on my own experience, that the effects of food can be compared to any other type of intoxicating substance. 

Food dramatically changes the way you feel, the effects can vary from intense feelings of pleasure and euphoria to a crippling loss of the will for action. This is highly dependent on the kinds of foods, timing, and quantity. There are neutral foods, as I will call them, but I have only ever discovered 2: *all-in-one nutritional powdered food (HUEL), and any kind of oatmeal followed by a large glass of water.*

The worst kinds of food are unfortunately, pasta, white bread, potatoes, any kind of heavy carbs. Ingested at lunch, this will incapacitate you from taking any further action. **This point should be avoided or delayed at all cost.**

Food should be rated on some sort of mood scale to determine what is safe to eat and what isn't.
