# Always do the best thing you can conceptualize
This is a simple question that you should be asking yourself constantly. Look at your day, at your activities, and ask whether this is the best you can imagine for any given day. The scope is important here, it is about that very moment in time, not some version of the future as those can easily be stripped of any realism. If you focus just on today, what does the best version of that day look like? Imagine in, then go for it.
