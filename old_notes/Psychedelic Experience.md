# Psychedelic Experience
- Psychedelics drive you out of the world of selves, time, moral judgments, self assertion, overvalued words and over worshiped concepts. (Huxley)
- 3 Days -> Preparation, experience and reintegration. (Leary, Huxley)

## Sensory Characteristics and Stages

- Three phases: Come-up, Peak, Come-down.
- Swelling and expanding of surfaces, vibrations, patterns, qualitative equivalent of breathing. The eye recovers some of the perpetual innocence of childhood, we feel things without jumping to conclusions about what they are –  *semsum vs. concept* (Huxley).
- Dissolution of the will to continue engaging in daily tasks, goals, etc. set by the ego (Huxley).
- 4 key characteristics: slowing of time, awareness of the polarity of things, awareness of relativity, awareness of eternal energy. (Watts)
- Three phases: Come-up, Peak, Come-down. (Leary)
- These compounds let you experience, at least in part the [[Istigkeit]] of things – their inherent *thinghood*.
- The mind under the influence of these substances perceives not in spatial relationships, but in terms of meaning, intensity of existence, profundity of significance (Huxley).

## Complications and Best Practices
- The fears and problems that can arise during a trip are due to the inherent incompatibility between mans egotism, and the purity of the psychedelic experience. The more he tries to hold onto that, the more problems arise. (Huxley)
- To remain undistracted is the difficulty, it is too easy to get caught up in past desires, failures, successes, etc. That can lead to a bad trip, a clinging to yourself, to the [[Western Ego]]. (Huxley)
- Anxiety comes from becoming aware of things we usually protect ourselves against. (Watts)
- Holding on to your ego is one of the gravest mistakes you can make. You will spend most of your time struggling to regain reality. The last stage of the trip will begin early and be full of hardships. (Leary)
	- Ego activity must be reduced, the attempt to control or rationalize what you are seeing will take you further away from the experience. (Leary)
	- Let the stream carry you along, don't hold on to any particular moment or experience. And even if you do, understand that this is okay and move on. Practice compassion with yourself and others at any and every step of the way.
	- Trust in the unity of life and in your companions, don't attach yourself to visions.
	- Don't flee the pain and don't pursue the pleasure. Recognition is all that is necessary, and being able to do this depends upon preparation.
- The key to a beautiful experience is in-action. Accept everything that happens passively. Imposing your will or seeking explanations as the experience happens, will threaten to pull you into a whirlpool of unpleasant hallucinations – a battle for reality that can last forever. (Leary)
- Companionship during these experiences is important and valuable. Seeking community and hurdling together during confusing periods and dark nights is something humans have done for centuries – do not create selfish thoughts, but exercise pure humbleness towards all. (Leary)
- Trying to verbalize and rationalize the experience as it happens can stop the flow. (Leary)
- An ego fixation can lead to the *plastic doll effect*: everything seems mass produced, artificial, distant, lifeless, goes along with feelings of isolation. (Leary)
- It is important to understand that all visions are a product of your mind, and are transient in nature. (Leary)
- Bodily sensations should not be treated as symptoms, they are natural effects of the experience, they are not negative in nature and should not be judged. (Leary)
- The setting becomes less important if the experience is well prepared and properly communicated between all participants – explore your goals and experiences mutually. (Leary)

## Reintegration of the Experience
- How to combine this unique perspective of seeing the world with your daily life we inevitable return to?
- We experience the gift of infinite contemplation, but this contemplation is incompatible with action or the will for action, or even the very thought of acting. *"When the sea flows in our veins and the stars are our jewels, what motive can we have for self assertion."* (Huxley)
- Re-entry is crucial and this is the time when we it is decided how the trip as a whole went. Stay calm and recognize where you are. (Leary)
	- Make sure to reenter voluntarily freely and with good grace, visualize this as an opportunity to better your ego existence. (Leary)
- Give yourself some time after the experience, your brain might need time to process before proper conclusions can be drawn. (Leary)

## Fascinating Quotes
- "Turn off your mind, relax, float downstream." (Leary)
- "To be shaken out of the ruts of ordinary perception, to be shown for a few timeless hours the outer and inner world, not as they appear to an animal obsessed with survival or to a human being obsessed with words and notions, but as they are apprehended directly and unconditionally by Mind at Large– this is an experience of inestimable value to everyone and especially to the intellectual." (Huxley)
- “But the man who comes back through the Door in the Wall will never be quite the same as the man who went out. He will be wiser but less cocksure, happier but less self-satisfied, humbler in acknowledging his ignorance yet better equipped to understand the relationship of words to things, of systematic reasoning to the unfathomable Mystery which it tries, forever vainly, to comprehend.” (Huxley)
- "Is it better to be part of the sugar or taste the sugar?" (Leary)
- "Liberation will be won simply through not disbelieving it upon hearing it." (Leary)
