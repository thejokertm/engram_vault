# Enlightenment
Aldous Huxley has one of the most practical and beautiful descriptions for the concept of enlightenment.

*“To be enlightened is to be aware, always, of total reality in its immanent otherness - to be aware of it and yet remain in a condition to survive as an animal. Our goal is to discover that we have always been where we ought to be. Unhappily we make the task exceedingly difficult for ourselves.”*
