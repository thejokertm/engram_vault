# Private Sphere
Keeping a life entirely to yourself entails deprivation from a process that is essential to human life. We need regular exchange with others to verify and solidify our ideas of the world around us, this is a key function of the [[Public Sphere]].

A lack of this objectivity among humans can lead to that sensation of loneliness so common to the modern world â€“ that sense of disconnect from reality. We are imprisoned in the singularity of our own experience (Arendt).

Private life as a desirable state of being is a modern invention. The advances in technology and society that lead to richer private lives come at the expense of the assurance of reality.

At the same time, we need the private life to shelter the intimate. There is a darker ground, a darkness that looses meaning when exposed to too much light.
