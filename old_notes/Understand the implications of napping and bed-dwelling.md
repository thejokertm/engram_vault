# Understand the implications of napping and bed-dwelling
When you wake up, make sure to get out bed as soon as you can. Staying in will make you foggy and groggy. Same with daytime napping. This is something that used to work for me, "power naps", but apparently does not work for me any more. I wake up feeling sick and confused. I suspect this is because I enter deep sleep too quickly, missing that crucial jumping off point.
