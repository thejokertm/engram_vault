# Test emotions and assumptions against biological conditions
When you perceive an emotion or make a novel assumption, always test these against possible biological dispositions to make sure that these are not tied, or even worse, a byproduct of these states. Possible biological dispositions include:

-   Sleep irregularity or deprivation
-   Under or over nourishment
-   Physically under or overworked
-   Dopamine deprived
-   Overconsumption of media/food/goods
    
Feelings, assumptions, and decisions that have a direct relation to biological dispositions are transient in nature, and thus do not follow our best interests. A common pattern is that these are geared toward immediate gratification or a relieve of the biological state in question.
