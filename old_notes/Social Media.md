# Social Media
Social media is one of the most dangerous inventions of our times, but here I want to offer an alternative perspective.

If you spend a long time on something, you want to share it, you want objective feedback, you are making these things for the world, not just for yourself. the internet and social media gives you a way to share your creations and make them better as a result. This process is an integral part of growth.
