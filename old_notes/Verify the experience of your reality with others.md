# Verify the experience of your reality with others
How do we know what is real and why does this question even matter? Reality provides us with structure, a common ground that we can all stand on, a set of laws we can all agree on. Arendt said that this reality depends entirely on *human plurality*. We are unable to say what anything is without distinguishing it from something else.

Make a habit of sharing new thoughts and models you develop in isolation, this will allow your thoughts to not only be expanded, but to be graced with the glitter of common truth.
