# Study your patterns and develop principles to deal with them effectively
Closely examine the patterns in your life, the problems that seem to repeat over and over again, to identify the cause and effect relationships behind them and allow you to deal with them appropriately in the future. Reality will show you whether your principles are working or whether they need to be adjusted. This learning produces a real-time feedback loop that will gradually enhance your understanding of reality. Ray Dalio describes a five-step plan to develop these principles.

1.  **Have clear goals:** Define what you want and reconcile your goals with your desires.
2.  **Identify your problems and don’t tolerate them:** don’t mistake a cause of a problem with the real problem, be precise and above all, do not tolerate problems, regardless of their severity.
3.  **Diagnose your problems to get at their root causes:** Get at the root causes by focusing on what is before deciding on a plan of action.
4.  **Design a plan and principles that will help you deal with the problem effectively and attain your goals:** practice higher-level thinking, look at the patterns and see what can be done to change them. Differentiate between the principles designed to deal with certain recurring problems and the plan you put in place to attain your goals.
5.  **Push through to completion:** Execute your plan and fine-tune your principles to deal with your problems. remember to have clear metrics to measure your success.
  
These steps are iterative, meaning that once you have completed a certain goal you start again from the top.
