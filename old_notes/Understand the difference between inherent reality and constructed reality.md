# Understand the difference between inherent reality and constructed reality
Inherent reality encompasses all that was there *a priori*, all that is truly natural. Things that exist objectively, without our involvement, belong to this category. 

Constructed reality, on the other hand, is all that we have build, all that does not exist without us (what Arendt calls the *Human Artifice*). It is our subjective understanding of the world, often far removed from the laws of nature. 

Very few things are actually real, most ideas surrounding us are constructed and hold no value on their own. These ideas often take the form of expectations placed upon us as if they were universal truths. As a consequence these ideas often limit and burden our thinking. These constructs cloud our thinking and drive us to satisfy illusory criteria instead of what we are really after. 

Understanding to differentiate between what is real and what is not allows us to focus on what matters and let go of what does not.
