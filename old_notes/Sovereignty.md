# Sovereignty
**The idea of uncompromising self sufficiency and mastery.**

Arendt says that this is impossible in a world where there are many as our sphere of influence always overlaps with somebody else's: *"Sovereignty is only possible in imagination, payed for by the price of reality."* I have yet to find a definition that is true to me, that works for my life. Stoicism solved this apparent problem by claiming that the world is an illusion.

This is deeply linked to my idea of [[Freedom]].
