When one of these criteria is met, time cannot possibly be wasted.

1.  **Lack of Awareness:** if one is engaging in an activity without being present, without actually experiencing the present, it becomes a waste of time.
2.  **Lack of Enjoyment:** if there is no happiness that can be derived from the activity, be it long term or short term, it is a waste of time. It is important to differentiate between enjoyment and immediate gratification, the latter being merely an illusion of happiness.

Whether or not something done is "worth it", is not dependent on whether it has generated any output or not. See [[productivity-myth|Productivity Myth]].
