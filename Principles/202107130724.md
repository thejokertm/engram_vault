A single source of truth will never be able to carry the burden of your consciousness. If you only get meaning from one thing, whatever that thing may be, you will not be happy. Understand that you have to diversify, you have to accumulate several sources of truth that hold the construct of your reality. These have to come from different sectors of your life, like social relationships, creative projects and so on. These kaleidoscopic experiences will shape your sense of meaning and secure it against falling apart as soon as one instance fades.
