When you perceive an emotion or make a new assumption, always test these against the following problematic influences:

-   Sleep irregularity or deprivation
-   [Eating](./the-effects-of-food.md) too much or too little
-   Physically under- or overworked
-   Dopamine deprivation or over stimulation
-   Overconsumption of media

In this way you can make sure that your current thinking is not tied, or even worse, a byproduct of these states.

These are closely related to [HALT](https://www.mindtools.com/acd2ov1/what-are-the-halt-risk-states) (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired). Feelings and assumptions that arise from any of these circumstances are transient in nature and should ideally not influence our decision-making. 

When we suffer from any of these factors, we do not have our best interest in mind. Our body is focused on survival, towards immediate gratification or a relief of the biological state in question.
