A very practical advice I have received throughout my life, is to leave multitasking to computers.

Focus on one thing and one thing only. See things through, one project at a time. Multitasking leads to frustration, and to feeling overwhelmed. Have a notebook always on the ready, ideas will come, but don't pursue them until you have completed the project at hand. Focus on sequential execution.
