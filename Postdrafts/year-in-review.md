How was my year and what have I learned? Reminescing. last post of the year, no update to zettelkasten.

Top 10 things I learned this year (?!)

1. Live now, do what you want to do as soon as you can do it.
2. Family matters. Be close to them however it may be feasible to you
3. Friends matter. Guess what, your relationships define your life. take good care of them.
