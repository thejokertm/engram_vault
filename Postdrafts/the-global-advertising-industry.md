A massive global advertising industry is tasked with the sole purpose of making you believe you are not enough, and you don't have enough. 

This system works by establishing a sense of deficiency in the consumer. No matter what you buy, it will never be sufficient. All things promise to make you whole, but they don't. They can't. And yet, advertising will have you believe that this particular cologne is going to change your life, make you feel like a jaguar running through the African wilderness. Right up until you realize that the feeling of being a cheetah chasing a Lamborghini would have been the better choice.

This is part of living in [hypercapitalism](./a-users-definition-of-hypercapitalism.md), where advertising has ceased to be about informing the buyer. It's not about facts, it's about telling you whatever it is you need to hear to buy, no matter the cost.

Practice to be content with what you have and who you are. Protect the integrity of your person. Nobody is going to do that for you. And remember that the only thing you really want is not for sale.
