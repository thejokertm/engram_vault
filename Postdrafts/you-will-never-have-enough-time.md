We will never have enough time for everything. Not because our minds are too ambitious, but because imagining things that we won't ever accomplish is a part of our human nature. This simple fact leads to a lot of suffering. There is a general lack of acceptance, of empathy towards our own condition.

Accept that not everything you can envision will become reality. In fact, most things won't. Stop punishing yourself for failures. Understand unfulfilled dreams as part of your condition, and move ahead to focus on those that do eventually come true.
