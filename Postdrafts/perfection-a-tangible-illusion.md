We can always envision greater things, bigger things. The absolute mastery over our own lives is something we can imagine, but that cannot ever fully be achieved. Perfection is conceivable, but it is not attainable. It is an illusion, a human construct. 

We are an integral part of what we are trying to master, and our ability to look at ourselves critically creates this point of frustration. Remember that, and work *with* the limits of your humanity, not against. 

This why we constantly struggle with the [productivity grind](productivity-myth.md). Our expectations are not realistic. In an age of machines, automation and artificial intelligence, we hold ourselves to a deeply inhumane standard. Do not expect anything less than imperfection from yourself. This should not lead you to inaction, rather, it should give you a frame to think about the outcome of your actions. The alternative is to live forever disappointed.
