A shift in consciousness. Look around. Suddenly, from here on out, everything is possible. Your sense of self dissolves instantly. There is nothing left, there are no limits to feel. The raw power of possibility fills your field of vision.

You exist, located in time and space. But you are everywhere, without any sense of self-imposed limitations. The true nature of things is revealed. We knew it all along, but it was as if we are not [paying attention](./the-practice-of-paying-attention.md). Did you not know that all this was make believe? Was that not clear to you?

I wanted to measure this instant, to contain it, to understand its length, its properties. All I can say is that it did not last. It was with me for an eternal moment, but that moment, it passed, replaced by the next. What I am left with is the dream. Our dream.

We can truly be anyone, we can re-define who we are and what we do. We can construct anything. As a matter of fact, we already did. We build a world that goes far beyond the material. Everything we see, do, and think feeds into a larger fable of life. And we all believe it, we have to. This tale holds us all together. It is our story. That is all it is.
