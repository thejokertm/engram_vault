I understand confrontation as a more directional sense of [pain](pain.md). The object of confrontation is localized in space, internal or external, and you most confront it, look at it, deal with it somehow. Action is required, it cannot just be endured.

Do not avoid confrontation. It can be painful, it can put you at odds with yourself, but it is also the only chance to progress. It is worth it because you will be refining what you thought you could do.

Don't run. Whatever it is that you are running from, it is going to catch up. The farther you run, the harder it is going to hit you â€“ don't prolong the inevitable. Face your fear and your own suffering. This is the only way forward.

We need friction in our lives. Hard and uncomfortable situations create meaning and allow us to make decisions.
