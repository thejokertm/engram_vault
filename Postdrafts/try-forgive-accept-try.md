Human fallibility is something to be accepted and embraced. It is a fact we cannot change, even if the entirety of the [global advertising industry](global-advertizing-industry.md) will have you believe otherwise. [Perfection](perfection-illusion.md) is inherently unattainable, even if it is imaginable. We are always going to fail, repeatedly. It is part of our nature. The question is, can we [forgive](forgiveness.md) ourselves?

A word often loaded with religious weight, all it really means is to accept a fact of nature that we cannot change, to have empathy with ourselves. Only then can we hope to change, to simply try again. This is the core of human purpose. To try, forgive, accept and try again. Nothing else is remains, everything else is an illusion.
