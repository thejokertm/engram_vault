One of the key understandings is knowing what we can change and what we can't. Only when we know the bounds of our ever-changing sphere of influence can we effectively focus our efforts and attention on things that matter.

World news is a good example of this. We are constantly bombarded with news from every corner of the globe, yet most of these events take place entirely outside our sphere of influence. This overflow of information clogs our brain with worry and anxiety. 

We typically tend to go in one of two extremes, we either underestimate or overestimate what we can change, and the story of our lives revolves around constantly [rebalancing that scale](private-and-public-life.md).
