We spend too much time lost in an imagined, perfect future and often disregard what we have right in front of us. We need to shift our focus from *then* to *now* and use our circumstances to live a minimum viable version of our dreams. Bring your visions to life with what you have in front of you.

Imagine you want to become an artist. You dream of a large fancy studio with lots of different canvases, a luxurious oil color collection and a variety of artist friends that celebrate your work. What would the minimum viable version of this dream look like?

Take a corner of your home, it doesn't have to be much, a small space, dedicate it to your artistic ambitions, buy a starter kit of affordable paint and join a local art group to meet likeminded people. And there you have it. Within days, you can be living a minimum, but viable version of your dream. It may not be [perfect](./perfection-is-an-illusion.md), but it is real. 

Be creative and find ways to live your dreams, now. Not tomorrow. This is a kind of mentality will always lead you to look for happiness where it already is, right here in the present.
