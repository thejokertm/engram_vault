Spending time with people will lead you to assume you can speak for them. It's only natural. You know them so well, your relationship to them is so good. This will always lead to a damage in that relationship, however slight. If practiced continuously, these fissures will accumulate and overtime, seriously fracture the relationship.

Don't speak for others, don't assume. If you absolutely must, make it clear in language that you are speaking for somebody else, ant that the statement in question might have to be revised. Stand corrected, if needed.
