![A woman standing on a stage](/_images/image-should-you-stay-or-go.webp "Should You Stay or Go?")

This week's notes tie in nicely to last week's theme of obsession. I often wonder how to know when to open myself to the world, or rather, to what degree?

If you let everything in, all the time, you give up your self to the point where living within our world of selves becomes impossible. But shutting the world out, while it has its deep and dark allure, leads to a deprived existence. It's about risk and reward. How much are you willing to put on the line to feel? How much pain are you willing to endure?

[Bed Bound](./bed-bound.md) is one extreme of the spectrum. It portrays the constant struggle, the clash with reality that can sometimes be too painful. [Performance Power](./performance-power.md) describes what can happen when you let the world in.

Both approaches can lead to a state of selflessness. To a point in time when your ego fades away. I would even say that both approaches have their validity, even if being overcome by a mesmerizing performance seems like a much healthier way to leave your body than losing your sense of self in between your bedsheets. 

The point is, the goalpost remains the same. But one path seems to lead you outward, the other inward. One path is riddled with pain and suffering, the other with joy and ecstasy. That is the range, the breath of human emotions. Sometimes, it has to be one extreme or the other. Sometimes, something in between. No matter what you choose, what overcomes you, it will always be your life.
