Obsession. You just can't seem to let it go.

That sensation of holding on to something so intensely, focusing on it with all of your attention. 

Everything about it has to be known and understood, observed, analyzed. This thing becomes something you could think about forever, it begins to claim your attention at times when it should not.

Is this a way of distraction? A way to hide from something greater, from something painful?

Like a parasite, these thoughts infect your brain and spread at an alarming rate. Before you know it, all you will be doing is thinking about it, and thinking about, and thinking about it.

Why? These parasitic thoughts create a safe place in your mind. A place where you feel protected. You choose this place over facing harder truths. But wait. Do you actually choose it? Or does it choose you?
