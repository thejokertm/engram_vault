Obsession. You just can't seem to let go.

That sensation of holding on to something so intensely, focusing on it with all of your attention. 

Everything about it has to be known and understood, observed, analyzed. When this thing becomes something you could think about forever, it begins to claim your attention at times when it should not.

Like a parasite, it infects your brain and spreads at an alarming rate. Before you know it, all you will be doing is thinking about it, and thinking about, and thinking about it.

Why? These parasitic thoughts create a safe place in your mind. A place where you feel protected. You choose this place over facing harder truths. Or do you actually choose it? Or does it choose you?

%%
- Why do we obsess over certain things as much as we do?
- Sensation of holding on to something so intensely, focusing on it with all of our attention. It is very much the way we spend time, but it often feels like an escape from facing harder thoughts and things, thinking about a piece of entertainment.
- Everything about a thing has to be known and understood, observed, analyzed. When this thing becomes something you could think about forever, it begins to claim your attention at times when it should not. It creates a safe place in your mind, something that you can always return to and receive comfort.
- You choose this place over facing harder truths.
- A peculiar place to do this is in bed, trying to fall asleep. Naturally, it is much more pleasant and easier to fall asleep to the latest video game than facing the incoherent nature of your existence. And maybe the minutes before drifting off aren't the proper place to tackle these questions anyways, but it concerns me that this is mostly **involuntary**, or at the very least, that I don't seem to have the mental muscle to counteract these swings.

## Relations to other thoughts
- This relates to addiction in a number of ways. I see parallels between my pursuit of altered states of awareness. This notion of escapism, of wanting to flee from my own life, can be daunting. And this is not because my life is so unbearable, it is not. It seems to me that the root of this is existence itself. Can it be reduced to "existence is Suffering"? I do not think it is that simple.
- Instead of facing hard questions, situations that make me uncomfortable, I choose to escape into digital worlds where reward circles are short and pre-programmed. Same thing with drugs.
- Except LSD. This particular substance brings you closer than you would ever want to be, a mixture of intoxication and the truth, it's allot to handle.
- Easy pleasure is a huge part in all this (quick-fix dopamine), taking the easier path, thinking things that make you happy easily and engaging in an activity more than you want to.
- This is key as it relates to behavior, I don't want to think about these things as much as I do, but it is proving to be difficult to change because facing life hurts.
- The pain is associated with something negative, something to avoid, when it should maybe be different, it should be associated with growth and with living a true live.
- There is a strong "getting to the bottom of this" sentiment, like there is some truth that cannot be shaken, waiting to be understood. I don't know if this is the case. But life as I understand it, is about the journey of getting as close as possible to that.
- Same thing with food, it provides this sense of comfort, like it fills me with pleasure briefly, before muting everything, nothing feels as good or bad anymore, I can just be, lay as an inanimate object, not having to face anything. See [[202109300706|Food Effects]]
- These things that I am running from, there is a layer that simply includes tedious and mundane tasks, such as cleaning, running errands, laundry, even making a meal when I really don't feel like it, or working out.
