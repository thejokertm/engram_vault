Human fallibility is something to be accepted and embraced. It is a fact we cannot change, even if the entirety of the [global advertising industry](./the-global-advertising-industry.md) will have you believe otherwise. [Perfection](./perfection-is-an-illusion.md) is inherently unattainable, even if it is imaginable. We are always going to fail, repeatedly. It is part of our nature. The question is, can we forgive ourselves?

A word often loaded with religious weight, all it really means is to accept a fact of nature that we cannot change, to have empathy with ourselves. Only then can we hope to change, to simply try again. 

This is the core of human purpose. **To try, forgive, accept and try again**. Everything else is simply not realistic.
