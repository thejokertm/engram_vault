The practice of paying attention, also referred to as meditation or mindfulness, teaches us to [trust our own nature](./deep-trust.md). This is one of the most valuable skills we can have, as it provides a protected space for us to weather out any storm that comes our way. It is an essential skill in the explorer's toolkit. To lead an examined life, we need to be able to listen, to remain in the present and study what ever presents itself.

Beyond that, so much of our life is at the mercy of the [global advertising industry](./the-global-advertising-industry.md) and [hypercapitalism](./a-users-definition-of-hypercapitalism.md). It is more important than ever to open our eyes and practice being here for our lives. 

Forget everything you have ever associated with meditation and remember only this: meditation is the practice of paying attention.
