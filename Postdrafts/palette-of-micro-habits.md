Besides [perspective shifts](perspective-shifts.md) and [active curiosity](active-curiosity.md), stick to your palette of micro habits. These are the small things, the little things you do every day, producing a cumulative impact. The combination of these micro habits, together with these broader life guiding principles, create a base from which to think and act clearly.
