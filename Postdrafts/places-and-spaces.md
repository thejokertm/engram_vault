![The jungle, an area of land overgrown with dense forest and tangled vegetation, typically in the tropics](/_images/image-places-and-spaces.webp "Places and Spaces")

I like to create from experience. There is something special about taking an intimately familiar place and turning it into something greater than the sum of its parts. Like little worlds of their own, these notes exist to evoke a feeling and transmit an idea.

A description of a place, based on a personal real-life experience, but abstracted into a concept to serve a greater purpose.

For me, [the jungle](./the-jungle.md) is one of those places. I grew up on the shores of the Caribbean, trying to figure out who I was in between the currents of the ocean and the mysteries of the jungle. This new world of questions and answers attracted me. The confrontation with the jungle is, at once, the confrontation with the beauty and danger of life.

The point is, this jungle can be anywhere, it is the jungle of your inner life. That door you don't dare to knock on. You might not even know that it's there. But trust me, it's there.

Entering this space and exposing yourself to uncertainty and a barrage of questions without an easy answer, it can feel pretty uncomfortable. But truly, what is the alternative? I never saw any.

There is a pretty stark contrast between how we rationally understand the world, and what the world is actually like. Our instinct for survival interferes with the truth. And it should, otherwise we wouldn't be here. The beauty of subjectivity is that no two mental images can ever be the same. What will you find in the jungle?
