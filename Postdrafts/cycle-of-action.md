Human fallibility is something to be accepted and embraced. It is a fact we cannot change, even if the [global advertising industry](./the-global-advertising-industry.md) will have you believe otherwise. 

[Perfection](./perfection-is-an-illusion.md) is imaginable but, ultimately, unattainable. We are always going to fail to some extent. It is part of our nature. Even when we succeed, it is never quite like we imagined it. 

Let's try to define a cycle of action that sees both failure and success as equals in a process to gain experience and live an examined life.

1. **Try (again) →** 
   This is our default. This is the mode where we push forward and try to make a difference for the betterment of our lives.
2. **Fail or succeed →**
   You will fail. You will succeed. The point is, either way, the next step is going to be the same. Failures sting, success make you feel good. Whatever it is, embrace it.
3. **Accept →**
   This is important, and often overlooked in our culture. Accept your nature, accept your own failures. And it seems to be just as hard to accept success.
4. **Learn →**
   With a level head, analyze critically what you can do different in the future. Sometimes it is not even about doing something different, but about extracting a valuable experience from a series of events. This is true for both failure and success.
   **Back to 1 →**

Neither success nor failure should ever interrupt this cycle. When looking at life this way, there is nothing special here. Everybody can try. There is no failure that's too painful and no victory that's too sweet. Every single outcome will teach you something valuable about yourself. Never be afraid to make progress just because you have been conditioned to believe there is a good and bad outcome. There isn't.
