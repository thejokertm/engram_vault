You never really know what you need until it is too late. In most cases this is not a big deal. Even after the fact, most situations can be salvaged with some damage control and course correction.

Regular perspective shifts are a preemptive measure. We all know what it feels like to leave the city you have been stuck in for just one day. Suddenly it's all there, you see your whole life in front of you, only now you are not a part of it anymore. You are outside of your everyday experience. A shift of perspective.

Turn this into a regular habit, and you are constantly forcing yourself to reevaluate your decisions, your routines. Question what you take for granted, and never get quite too comfortable. Constantly find ways to break out of routines and structures, to change your external conditions, surroundings and people.
