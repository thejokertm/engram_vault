Deep Trust is a deep-seated belief in yourself, not because you possess something others don't, but because you are human, you are a self-aware creature of action that already has available to them everything required to live. A being with an intuition that taps into the currents of the universe, currents that have guided many before you, and will guide those that come after your time is up.

*Urvertrauen*, Basic or Deep Trust â€“ a form of intrinsic belief in the perseverance of the human spirit, in the unquantifiable currents that guide our lives. A trust in your decisions, no matter their outcome.

That is the only belief worth having. The belief in your humanity. Not in God, not in anything that is out there. Not in skills or a superior intellect, not in beauty, or any form of acquired capabilities. Just in what you are.

The singular source of Deep Trust is the constancy of consciousness. That space in which everything arises is forever present and accessible to all (see [Paying Attention](./the-practice-of-paying-attention.md)). It is the only thing that remains when all else fades.

Give yourself to life, to time and flow with the river, only then can you be sure to see a great many things.
