A deep seated belief in yourself, not because you posses something others don't, but because you are human, you are a self-aware creature of action that already has available to them everything required to live. A being with an intuition that taps into the currents of the universe, currents that have guided many before you, and will guide those that come after your time is up.

*Uhrvertrauen*, Basic or Deep Trust â€“ a form of intrinsic belief in the perseverance of the human spirit, in the unquantifiable currents that guide your life. A trust in your decisions, no matter their outcome.

The only belief worth having is the belief in yourself. Not in God, not in anything that is out there. Not in skills or a superior intellect, not in beauty, or any form of acquired capabilities. Just in what you are.

Give yourself to life, to time and flow with the river, only then can you be sure to see a great many things.
