Diversification is a basic strategy that is often used in investing. the idea is simply: don't put all your eggs in one basket. make sure to have various avenues of possible success.

Try a variety of ideas on a small scale, set them up in a way where they generate income on their own, with minimal investment. once something small works, you have the option to scale up.

A single source of truth will never be able to carry the burden of your consciousness. If you only get meaning from one thing, whatever that thing may be, you will not be happy. Understand that you have to diversify, you have to accumulate several sources of truth that hold the construct of your reality. These have to come from different sectors of your life, like social relationships, creative projects and so on. These kaleidoscopic experiences will shape your sense of meaning and secure it against falling apart as soon as one instance fades.
