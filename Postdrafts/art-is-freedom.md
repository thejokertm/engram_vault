Artistic expression is the purest form of freedom, or shall I say, unadulterated expression of any kind, doing and saying what you feel to be true, without laws or rules dictated by external systems. That is freedom.

The only law that matters is to respect the boundaries of your freedom, and the beginning of another mans freedom. It can be quite simple. Live a self determined life without hurting others, not at the direct cost of others.
