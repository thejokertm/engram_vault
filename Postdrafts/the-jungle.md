**[jun·gle](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/jungle)** *| ˈjəNGɡəl |*\
noun
1. an area of land overgrown with dense forest and tangled vegetation, typically in the tropics.
2. a wild tangled mass of vegetation or other things.
3. a situation or place of bewildering complexity or brutal competitiveness.

A place far removed from what you would call home. A place, new but familiar at once. Traversal makes you feel an [urgency of connection](./deep-trust.md) with the world and all beings in it, that excitement as your senses are flooded with raw beauty, danger and love, yes, *welcome to the jungle*.

This space is hostile towards any form of life. The danger feels natural, it belongs to a world where safety and comfort are earned. Every step could be your last, not because of some mechanical malfunction, but because you are at the mercy of nature.

This is freedom, to live and to die, not on the merits of a technocracy, but on account of the highest court of nature.

An abundance of life, making itself heard in a myriad of ways. Living, breathing beings in all shapes and sizes populate this space. Visitors may see themselves as intruders, but they are not. Here, all life falls neatly into a hierarchical chain of being.

A feast for the sense, the colors, shades of green, lush vegetation all around, thick layers of verdant mysteries extend into every possible direction. The air is humid and heavy. The outer edges of your body seem to lose their meaning. Your boundaries dissolve ever slightly, allowing for a state of flow within this orchestra of symphonic vibrations.

This rawness of existing, this connection with the world you cannot escape, a confrontation of being, of living, not within the artificial comforts of erected walls, but within an ecosystem of flowing consciousness that you are merely a part of. No place on earth lets you experience this spectacle like the deep jungle.
