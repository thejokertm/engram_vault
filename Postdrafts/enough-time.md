We will never have enough time for everything. Not because our minds are too ambitious, but because imagining things that we won't do is a part of human nature. This simple fact leads to allot of suffering. There is a general lack of acceptance, of empathy with our own condition.

What complicates matters even more is that of all the things we envision, we can never quite tell which one will come true, if any at all. The sooner you accept that you will never achieve *all* your dreams, the sooner you can begin to focus on the [essential](the-essential.md) things that have the highest emotional impact. You will never feel like your life is in control, that feeling, as soon as you experience it, it slips away, turns into something else. At last, the only thing to remember, is that you cannot do everything, but you can certainly do something. We either vastly overestimate or underestimate what we are capable of.
