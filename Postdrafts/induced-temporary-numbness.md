A self-induced state of numbness. A way to remain arrested and empty for a period of time. The goal is to stop thinking and feeling. 

How to stop the chattering mind? There are 2 aspects to this undertaking.

1. The mind needs to be kept occupied, entertained almost, with minimal effort. This is best accomplished by subjecting yourself to an infinite stream of mildly entertaining video content. Your mind will be occupied, the chatter will stop. Whatever occupies the mind just enough so that you can have your peace.
4. Make sure to induce big serotonin and dopamine hits frequently. This can be achieved by a many ways, such as eating trigger foods. This will leave you feeling empty. There will be a perceived nothingness that takes hold over your experience.

You will remain in this state for a few hours, up to several days, but you will not loose yourself in it, you will always find back. There is such an attractive beauty in this mode of arrested being. It is a form of short term suicide, you brutally bring your mind and body to a standstill, erasing all feelings and sensations.

But do not be mistaken, re-birth is anything but pleasant or refreshing. You have to brute force yourself out of this state. The way out is the same way you came in. This is the luxury to not feel, the luxury of temporary numbness. Enjoy in moderation.
