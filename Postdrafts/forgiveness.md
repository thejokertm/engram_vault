Humans are completely imperfect, forgive their fallibility, and your own. Forgive them and forgive yourself. Remember the pain, and remember that good people can do bad things.

Humans are good, but are often misguided. That does not change their human essence â€“ to love and to be loved. All of these things we do, the acts we play, we all just want one thing, however misguided some attempts may be.
