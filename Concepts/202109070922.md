Philosophical suicide is any attempt to explain away the inherent lack of meaning in our universe. Such as religion, the attribution of meaning to life after death, a paradise that awaits us, making all the suffering here on earth worth it, have meaning.

When we abolish this truth, the absurdity of our desire for meaning and the wolds lack thereof, we commit philosophical suicide. Its a cop-out, any belief in greater meaning is a cop-out that protects us from the unbearable truth. Camus said that the solution to this is to accept the absurd and relish in the ultimate form of intellectual suicide.
