Being alive comes with a list of symptoms, the endless breathing for a time that seems simultaneously short and much too long, that feeling of being in your own body can be both magnificent and terrifying all at once. Facing the question of what we are, what we have and want to become, to fully realize the power of your own actions, it can be overwhelming. It's always easier to "go do something else."

It is allot to deal with, all the time. We have simplified our daily experience, become numb to so many things that happen to us all the time. Some would have you believe this condition is an illness that needs to be medicated. Aldous Huxley has a pretty somber outlook:

*"Most men and women lead lives at the worst so painful, at the best so monotonous, poor and limited that the urge to escape, the longing to transcend themselves if only for a few moments, is and has always been one of the principal appetites of the soul." â€“ There is a need for chemical vacations from intolerable self-hood."*

This is of course, an extreme. Yet I have always felt that sense of escapism more than others, or maybe I have acted on it more than others.
