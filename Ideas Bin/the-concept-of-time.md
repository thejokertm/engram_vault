Time is a dimension. Just like we measure distance with rulers, we can measure time with clocks. There is no past, no future. There is only our present experience. 

Time is not a resource, it cannot be wasted. Time exists as a space of moments we call the present, moments that have no objective connection. There is no process in nature that converts the present to the past, or the future to the present.

The only way to be with time is to see it for what it is, a concept needed to live in our world. Just like distance and velocity.
