Stuff. Stuff. Stuff. There is always more stuff to buy, to look at, and to occupy our attention with. The question of what we actually need takes a backseat.

We can build categories of necessity, such as foods, shelter, water, exercise or physical maintenance, social relationships, even certain environmental conditions are essential for us to live. But in todays world, those are covered for a significant majority.

Beyond that however, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand what is taking more from us than its giving. Being aware of these attention hog can help. The reality is that most things are not worth it. Even if we are manipulated to believe otherwise on a daily basis, curtesy of the global advertising industry.

Pause before you let something into your life, think carefully about that streaming subscription, that new fancy coffee maker. How much joy do these things really add? 

To indulge or not to indulge, its an input-output calculation.
Most things are not worth it.
