Develop a work ethic that servers *you* first and foremost, not a [capitalistic system](../Postdrafts/a-users-definition-of-hypercapitalism.md). Cultivate a morale, a certain type of discipline that regards your well being as the key success metric, not financial gain (see [Productivity Myth](../Postdrafts/productivity-myth.md)). 

Work on the things that mean something to you. Things that you actually care about, things that you have a stake in, that you have a direct relationship with.
