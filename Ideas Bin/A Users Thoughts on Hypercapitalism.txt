# A Users Thoughts on Hypercapitalism

Let's make one thing clear. Despite what the following may lead you to believe, I am not against capitalism. This particular collection of processes and commonly held beliefs was created to incentivize competition and progress, it was supposed to provide  a common wealth for all, as long as you did your part. Separating the worker from the means of production comes with its own set of problems, yes. But I feel that these problems where allot easier to digest when a large majority was reaping the rewards of an ever increasing level of common wealth. Hypercapitalism is a perversion of the former, a broken promise, a testament to the inherent greed spreading within all of us. But as we shall see, it is that very drive for action that has been turned against us.
