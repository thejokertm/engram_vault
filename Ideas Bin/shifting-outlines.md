A feeling so porefull that if fails to qualify as a feeling. A shift in conciousness, suddenly, from here on out, looking around the room, everything was possible. There were no limits, no sense of self, or of limitations. I was still there, located in space and in my body, but without any sense of self-imposed limitation whatsoever. 

For an instant I saw that we can be anyone, we can re-define who we are and what we do, everything that you think you know about yourself is a carefully constructed illusions, nessesary for survival and day-to-day, yes. But it can be reprogrammed, changed, to your advantage.
