Find ways to live the life you want with the things you already have. Neville Goddard among others, spoke about this at length in what is generally referred to as the law of assumption. The idea is simple, Imagine the things you wish for, experience them with all your being as if they are already present, and you will attract their manifestation.

I propose a more practical approach to this method, instead of simply using the power of imagination to live your desired outcome, use the things available to you, your circumstances, to get as close as you can to your desired outcome. This will often involve a minimum viable version of your dreams that already has the power to bring happiness and satisfaction to your life.

If you want to be more creative, for example, but don't have the space, the tools, the means, work with what you have. This is a kind of abundance mentality that will always lead you to look for happiness where it already is, right here in the present.
