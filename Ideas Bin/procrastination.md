Procrastination. The lac of motivation to engage in a task, is not a time management problem. It is not fixed by more todo lists or time tracking. It is an emotional problem. You are afraid of the pain, the resistance of doing the most important thing.

This is why you turn to easier things. You don't want to do nothing, but you also don't want to feel the pain of doing something.
