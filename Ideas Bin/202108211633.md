The miracle of naked existence, not perceivable through the ego lens. Language cannot describe what a thing is, by attempting to abstract we destroy the essence of things. Looking at things without the lens of self hood allows us to, in theory, see them for what they really are, nothing is pretending to be anything else. By abstracting and describing, the things we attempt so desperately to capture loose something inherent to them: their thing-hood.

This is, as Hofmann states, the secret to life. There is no secret to be found or uncovered, the secret is the thing itself and our connection to it. But we cannot do that, as Arendt says, we cannot understand or comprehend our own nature, we cannot answer who we are, which in turn would lead us to commit [[202109070922|Philosophical Suicide]] and construct a deity.

Huxley said that the painter Johannes Vermeer was better at capturing the essence of things than anyone else. I have observed that the way he understands how light is what gives things color, shape, atmosphere and ultimately, meaning, is truly unique. See *Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window*.
