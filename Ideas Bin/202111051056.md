The idea to truly make more of your time, but by being present, by not being focused too much on your past and on your future.

The past should serve only as a background of experience to make decisions in the present. The past is there to learn from, not to dwell on. The past is nothing to be changed or influenced, draw on your past to make educated decisions.

The present, the "now", is the actual experience of your life, this is the moment as you feel it happening. Most of your attention and energy should flow into being present and open to absorb what you actually are experiencing. This is essentially your life.

Thinking about your future should only ever serve one purpose and that is to continue to assure a worthwhile present. This is important, but should not be your primary focus, getting lost in future events and expectations is going to distract you form ever living your actual life, which takes place in the present.

In that sense, the past needs to be frequently reviewed and learned from, the present needs to be experienced, and the future needs to be adequately prepared.

The greatness we strive for, the ambition, can be a dangerous trap, an overwhelming river of responsibilities with no way out â€“ it is better to live than to rule the world.
