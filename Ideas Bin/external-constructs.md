One of the key understandings that can guide our lives as human beings, is knowing what we can change and what we can't. Only when we grasp our ever changing sphere of influence can we adequately direct our attention and energy towards the things that have an impact. 

World news is a good example of this. We are constantly bombarded with news from every corner of the globe, yet most of these events take place entirely outside of our sphere of influence. Yet the clog our brain with worry and anxiety. We typically tend to go in one of two extrems, we either underestimate or overestimate what we can change and the story of our lives revolves around constantly rebalancing that scale.


Don't focus on external constructs too much, because you cannot always control that outcome, yes you dislike capitalism at its core, don't focus on that, focus on how you can buy yourself time. Keep [Internal and External Balance](balance-external-internal.md).
