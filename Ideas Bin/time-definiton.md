## Guiding Questions for this Page
- Time as a Ressource, the most valuable currency, or time as being something in us, the fabric of the world, of humanity?
- How can we be time? What would that even mean?
- how do we perceive time? What does that even mean?
	- We only have the present, every single instant.
- Our obsession with measuring the passing of time vs. valuing the moment.
	- Isnt the best feeling when we forget about the concept of time entirely?

	- Carlo rovelli suggests that time is an illusion
	- Basically, the whole universe is a sequence of events, of cause and effect. We project onto it a notion of past, present and future, an order of things that is not real.
	- Space is a factor, two events might be happening in opposite order depending from where you look. It is relative to your position.
	- Reality is many "presents" that we connect to create meaning.

	- Time has a subjective flow to it, it passes at perceived different speeds for everybody.
	- Even if we can measure it objectively, what is the real weight of that if the present can be so radically different depending of how we choose to design it?
	- Einstein proved that the perception of time depends on motion, there is no universal now. This is was makes past present and future meaningless.
	- My past is your future, and so on.
	- The idea of the passing of time is so entrenched in us, it is hard, i
	- f not impossible to let it go, but should it?
	- psychologically the arrow of times makes sense, as memories can only be built from the past.
